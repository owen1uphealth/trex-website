The T-Rex, also known as Tyrannosaurus rex, was a huge meat-eating dinosaur that lived a long, long time agoâ€”about 68 to 66 million years ago! Back then, the world looked very different, with lots of coastal areas, dry lands, and forests filled with all sorts of plants and animals.

Most T-Rex fossils have been found in North America, in places like Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming, and even in Canada. There's a chance they lived in parts of Mexico too!

The world T-Rex lived in was full of life, with plants like ferns, cone-bearing trees, and flowers that other plant-eating dinosaurs loved to munch on. There were many other dinosaurs, like the three-horned Triceratops and the duck-billed Edmontosaurus, which the T-Rex might have hunted for food. There were also smaller dinosaurs, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians living alongside them.

T-Rex was a big, strong predator that could roam far and wide looking for food, without having a specific place to call home. It was the top of the food chain, which means it didn't have many enemies to worry about. With lots of places to find food, as well as places to hide and ambush its prey, T-Rex's world was the perfect place for this giant dinosaur to thrive!
