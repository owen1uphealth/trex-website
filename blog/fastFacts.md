1. Big Name, Big Dinosaur: T-Rex, short for Tyrannosaurus Rex, means "tyrant lizard king." It lived about 68-66 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous Period.

2. Giant Size: T-Rex was one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs, growing up to 40 feet (12 meters) long and weighing around 7-9 tons, which is about the weight of an elephant!

3. Powerful Bite: T-Rex had a super-strong bite, with a force of about 8,000 pounds (3,629 kilograms). That's strong enough to crush bones!

4. Tiny Arms: Even though T-Rex was huge, it had tiny arms that were only about 3 feet (1 meter) long. Scientists think they might have been used to hold prey or help the dinosaur get up from lying down.

5. Sharp Teeth: T-Rex had up to 60 sharp, serrated teeth that were up to 9 inches (23 centimeters) long. These teeth helped T-Rex bite through tough dinosaur skin.

6. Fast Runner: T-Rex was a fast runner, even though it was so big. It could reach speeds of 10-25 miles per hour (16-40 kilometers per hour).

7. Carnivore: T-Rex was a meat-eater, and it liked to eat other dinosaurs. Some of its favorite meals might have included Triceratops and Edmontosaurus.

8. Good Smeller: T-Rex had a great sense of smell, which helped it hunt for food. Its big olfactory bulbs (smelling parts of the brain) helped it sniff out prey from far away.

9. Fossil Discoveries: The first T-Rex fossil was discovered in 1902 by Barnum Brown, a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History. Since then, more than 50 T-Rex skeletons have been found!

10. Famous Dinosaur: T-Rex is one of the most well-known dinosaurs, and it has appeared in many movies, books, and TV shows. You might have seen it in the movie Jurassic Park or heard about it in the book "How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?"
