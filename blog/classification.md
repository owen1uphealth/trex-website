There are seven major levels of classification: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. The two main kingdoms we think about are plants and animals. Sometimes an eighth level above the Kingdom called the Domain is used.

## Classification for Humans

Here is an example of how humans are classified. You will see that our species is homo sapiens:

- Kingdom: Animalia
- Phylum: Chordata
- Class: Mammalia
- Order: Primates
- Family: Hominidae
- Genus: Homo
- Species: Homo sapiens

## Classification for the T-rex
This is the entire classification of the T-rex species:

- Kingdom: Animalia
- Phylum: Chordata
- Clade: Dinosauria
- Clade: Saurischia
- Clade: Theropoda
- Family: Tyrannosauridae
- Subfamily: Tyrannosaurinae
- Genus: Tyrannosaurus
- Species: Tyrannosaurus rex


## Related Species

You can see relatives of the T-rex here. They all share the same Family (Tyrannosauridae), but they branch to different species from there.
