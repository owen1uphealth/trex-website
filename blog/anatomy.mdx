The Tyrannosaurus Rex was about 40 feet in length - about the size of a school bus. It weighed around 5-8 tons. Their heads were over 4 feet long, with very powerful jaws.

The T. Rex had quite a large brain for a dinosaur. This would have helped it hunt better! Large parts of its brain helped its vision and smell - it may have even had telescopic vision.

Even more terrifying was its mouth full of 8 inch (20cm) teeth - long and sharp, like knives.

Scientists are not exactly sure how T. rex used its arms, but they know that they were too short to help with eating.
