Tyrannosaurus rex was a big, scary dinosaur with sharp teeth, strong legs, and teeny tiny short arms. It mostly liked to hunt for food by itself, but since T. rex had short arms, it probably hunted in groups with other T. rex so that they could catch bigger animals. T. rex was really good at biting its prey (like an alligator) and pulling its teeth through the meat and bones to make long cuts. T. rex liked to eat dinosaurs like stegosaurus' and triceratops. Some dinosaur scientists think that T. rex might have also eaten meat from animals that had already died.

There is even some evidence that T. Rex's participated in play for fun! Scientists have discovered a few fossil sites where a group of T. rex bones were found where they were laid out in ways that look like they engaged in play fighting, similar to the way dogs wrestle to get their energy out. Nearby to those adult bones, were egg nests and baby T. rex bones, which could mean that some of these big dinos lived and worked together to take care of the kids and each other.
