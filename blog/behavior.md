Tyrannosaurus rex was probably a solitary hunter, since there is no fossil evidence (bone beds of T. rex fossils) to support packs of T. rex. T. rex relied on its huge jaws, sharp teeth and powerful, clawed legs during attacks. According to some studies, T. Rex were found to hunt in groups due to their extremely short front limbs (arms). Their front limbs were not sufficient to break the defense mechanisms of the prey. The patterns of the bites also gave some indication of the actual feeding technique of T. rex, which apparently indicated 2 distinct biting behaviours, usually involving the "puncture and pull" strategy in which the teeth bite deeply into the food with great force then pulling the teeth through the penetrated flesh and bone, the result being long gashes. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger.
