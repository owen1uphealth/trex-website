Tyrannosaurus rex was a big, scary dinosaur with sharp teeth, strong legs, and teeny tiny short arms. It mostly liked to hunt for food by itself, but since T. rex had short arms, it probably hunted in groups with other T. rex so that they could catch bigger animals. T. rex was really good at biting its prey (like an alligator) and pulling its teeth through the meat and bones to make long cuts. T. rex liked to eat dinosaurs like stegosaurus' and triceratops. Some dinosaur scientists think that T. rex might have also eaten meat from animals that had already died.
