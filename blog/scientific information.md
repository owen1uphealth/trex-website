Tyrannosaurus rex is the primary and most well-known species within the genus Tyrannosaurus. There is no widely accepted subspecies designation for T. rex. However, it is essential to note that paleontological discoveries and taxonomic revisions can change over time as new evidence is found and analyzed. As such, it is possible that future findings may reveal subspecies or new species within the Tyrannosaurus genus.
