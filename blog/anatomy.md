Tyrannosaurus rex, whose name means "king of the tyrant lizards," was built to rule. This dinosaur's muscular body stretched as long as 40 feet—about the size of a school bus—from its snout to the tip of its powerful tail. Weighing up to eight tons, T. rex stomped headfirst across its territory on two strong legs. T. rex's upper (femur) and lower (tibia) leg bones are much longer than those of far earlier meat-eaters like Allosaurus. T. rex's svelte limbs are stubbier proportionately than those of the ostrich-mimic ornithomimid dinosaurs. T. rex's arms were powerfully muscled and ended in two mobile fingers with large claws. Scientists are not exactly sure how T. rex used its arms, but they know that they were too short to help with eating. One hypothesis is that T. rex's arms became shorter as its head grew more massive to prevent the dinosaur from becoming top-heavy.
