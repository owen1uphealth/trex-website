T-Rex loved to eat other dinosaurs, but it didn't just stick to one kindâ€”it liked to try different types of dino meals! One of its favorite snacks was the Triceratops, which had a big body and a tough shield around its neck to help protect it from hungry predators. But T-Rex had super-strong jaws that could bite through that shield and take down the Triceratops for dinner.

Another dinosaur T-Rex might have enjoyed eating was the Edmontosaurus, which was smaller but still made a big meal for our toothy friend. Some scientists even think T-Rex might have munched on water animals like turtles or fish that lived in the rivers where it roamed.

T-Rex mostly ate meat, but it's possible that it sometimes snacked on other things, like little mammals, lizards, or even bugs. We don't have a lot of fossils to prove this, so we can't be sure. But one thing is clear: T-Rex was an amazing hunter that loved trying all kinds of food to keep itself big and strong!
