T-Rex was a big dinosaur that liked to eat other dinosaurs. It had very strong jaws that could bite through the tough shield around the neck of a Triceratops, which was one of its favorite snacks. T-Rex also liked to eat smaller animals like little mammals, lizards, or even bugs. It was an amazing hunter that loved trying all kinds of food to keep itself big and strong!ðŸ¦•
