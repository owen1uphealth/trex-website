While the T-Rex's diet was mainly composed of other dinosaurs, it is believed that it had a diverse range of prey. For example, the Triceratops, one of the T-Rex's primary prey, had a bulky frame and a thick frill that served as protection against predators. To overcome these obstacles, the T-Rex likely used its strong jaws to bite through the frill and neck of the Triceratops, ultimately bringing it down.

The T-Rex may have also targeted herbivorous dinosaurs such as the Edmontosaurus, which was smaller in size but could still provide a substantial meal for the predator. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that the T-Rex may have occasionally preyed upon aquatic animals, such as turtles or fish, that lived in the rivers and streams of its habitat.

While the T-Rex's diet was primarily composed of meat, it is possible that it also consumed other non-dinosaurian animals such as smaller mammals, lizards, or insects. However, due to the lack of fossil evidence for these prey items, it is difficult to say for certain. Overall, the T-Rex was a fearsome and efficient predator that likely had a varied diet to sustain its massive size and strength.
